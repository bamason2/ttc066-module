### Example 2: Bouncing Ball Model Vertical Component Only

A simple bouncing ball model based on the schematic below can be created as follows.

*Figure 2: Ball bounce model*

When the ball is in contact with the ground this is very similar to the suspension, except that the road wonâ€™t move up and down and the reference is the ground, so the sign of positive $z_b$ is different.

The obvious state choice is $x_1=z_b$ and $x_2=\dot{z}_b$ and there is no input, $u$ here. The model is;

$$
\begin{cases}
{\dot{x}_1=x_2} & \text{if } x_1<r \\
\dot{x}_2=\frac{K}{M}\left(r-x_{1}\right)-\frac{B}{M} x_{2} &\\
{\dot{x}_1=x_2} & \text{otherwise}\\
\dot{x}_2=-g &\\
\end{cases} $$

It's interesting that we're modelling mass, $M$ in the case if $z_b<r$ (in the $\frac{K}{M}$ and $\frac{B}{M}$ coefficients) but not modelling weight in this case.  Compare with the *otherwise* case, where the acceleration is only due ot the weight (the $-g$ comes from $F=ma$ where the force is the ball weight).

In the ball model, there is no input ($u$) so we run different scenarios by setting different initial conditions, $x_1(0), x_2(0)$.  In the suspension model we can also set initial conditions (and see how the suspension settles) and / or we can define a road input over time and play this into the model as it integrates.  With the full set of information;

- Model
- Initial conditions, $\mathbf{x}(0)$
- Input(s) over time, $\mathbf{u}(t)$
